## PROBLEM 

To fullfil the 3rd "Origami" space craft category of Space Apps 2016, Stellar Folds worked to solve the issue of rover shut down and connectivity loss because of the limited radius of rover travel on Mars (or other planets)


"self assembling or self-propelling robots"

## PURPOSE 

These small self-propelling and (for now) paper robots would be able to self-distribute and create a mesh network, increasing the radius of rover operation and even providing a methodology for "rescue" bots to serve broken rovers.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Self-assembling and self-propelling robots made of economical origami paper prototypes
