## PURPOSE 

To populate a planet with self-distributed rovers and create a mesh network, increasing the radius of rover operation and even providing a methodology for "rescue" bots to serve broken rovers.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Hundreds of wind-powered origami rovers are soft landed onto a terrestrial planet in cylinder-packed containers that deploy them at an interval between shifting wind patterns to scatter the rovers as much as possible.

Internal tension pulls the rover into its spherical shape immediately upon deployment.

The shell is based on the origami "magic ball" design but instead of a 1:2 ratio we found that a 3:4 ratio sheet will lock in a football shape on its own due to the shape of the triangles at the end and the tension spread across the surface.
